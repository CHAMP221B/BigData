Setting up Master:-
- getenforce										checks whether antivirus is on or off.
- setenforce 0										disables antivirus
- iptables -F										disables firewall
To make above changes permanent write them in /root/.bashrc 
- ifconfig											to know the network configuration or IP.
- vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s3		
In the above file write the below commands to make the ip address of the system static.
BOOTPROTO=static
IPADDR=(set ip)
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=(to see gateway type "route -n" in shell and write here)(gateway is the network to which your pc is connected)
DNS1=8.8.8.8
ONBOOT=yes
(save the file using esc -> :wq -> enter)
- systemctl restart network
now ping google by writing "ping goo.gl" in shell
if you get response then your system is working.


Setting up Slave:-
Do the same process for slave as for master but give a different ip to every slave.

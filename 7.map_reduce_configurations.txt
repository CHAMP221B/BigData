Map-Reduce:-

Tasktracker:- 
- vi /etc/hadoop/core-site.xml
- put the address of hdfs in above file.
- vi /etc/hadoop/mapred-site.xml
write the below lines in this file
<configuration>
<property>
<name>mapred.job.tracker</name>
<value>jobtracker_IP:9002</value>
</property>
</configuration>

- Do everything same as we did in slave.{hdfs-site.xml, core-site.xml etc.}

Jobtracker:-
- Do same thing in jobtracker as we did in Tasktrackers.
- To see all the active trackers 
	"hadoop job -list-active-trackers "
- UI port: 50030 (jobtracker_IP:50030)


Client:- 

do below things in client
- vi /etc/hadoop/mapred-site.xml
write the below lines in this file
<configuration>
<property>
<name>mapred.job.tracker</name>
<value>jobtracker_IP:9002</value>
</property>
</configuration>

- There is an already made program for word count 
	"hadoop jar /usr/share/hadoop/hadoop-examples 1.2.1.jar wordcount /filename.txt /ouput"
- To see the wordcount in output file.
	"hadoop fs -cat /output/part-r-00000"

Now write map reduce code according to your needs.
